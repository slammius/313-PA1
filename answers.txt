Comparing the recieved file with the original file, I noticed that the recieved file and the original one were indentical.
This was done using the diff Linux command. I also measured different file sizes and how long it took to transfer their
data to a test bin, which can be in a table shown below in MB.

File Size(MB)      Time(s)
25                 .29
50                 .25
75                 .26
100                .24

The transfer time for my system is roughly identical, with no real trend for increasing file size. Bigger file sizes should
take longer to transfer, but as shown this is not the case. It's most likely from my system being powerful enough
to do these operations regularly and efficiently. On older systems, it will take longer to transfer file sizes. For my 
system, the main bottleneck isn't filesize, but rather, the pipe between client.cpp and server.cpp.
